# Market Gard Bots
2 robots 

## Summary

We want to focus on interaction with little kids, and make a cute, car-like robot that can bring them happiness and also communicate with them. There will be many moving creatures surrounded by children, when they touch them, the creature will say different words such as “Hello” and “How are you” that expect children to answer and have some interaction.

## Component Parts

Arduino boards/ 2 DC motors / distance sensors/ battery pack/ basket body (decorated with different elements such as beads, fur, fabric, lights, etc)/ h bridge motor shields/ cardboard or poly bottom/ 4 wheels

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposals, flush out initial code for our idea. We take the code we used in a previous project as reference for the arduino bots. 
- Week 2: Refine the idea and shop for the materials, we gathered up what we need and discussed about what we going to make the bots attractive and practical with the materials we chose.
- Week 3: Figured out the real physicality of the bots! We put up the bots together and bring them to interact with people and see how they react in different environment, and how they function with different groud. We also based on the feedbacks and did minimal trouble shooting and change, and we documented the interaction and function.
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

It was hard to use bamboo basket to make the bots' body. We used the plant containers we purchased at Ikea. In order to make it functional and not giving up on the aesthetic at the same time, we experiment a lot with different placements of the parts. The walking code was also a bit confusing that same code works differently on each bot, the censor seems to not work properly for a while. if we have more time we'd go in, fix and polish them a bit more.
