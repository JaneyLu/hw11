# Moving Creatures (basket robots)
5 robots 

## Summary

I want to focus on interaction with little kids, and make a cute, car-like robot that can bring them happiness and also communicate with them. There will be many moving creatures surrounded by children, when they touch them, the creature will say different words such as “Hello” and “How are you” that expect children to answer and have some interaction.

## Component Parts

Arduino boards/ 4 DC motors / distance sensors/ light sensor/ shining LEDs/ battery/ basket body (decorated with different elements such as beads, fur, fabric, lights, etc)/ h bridge/ cardboard or poly bottom
